# Models for real mobile networks

*The purpose of this project is to analyze the properties of different mobiles networks and compare the results to the ones obtained on mobile networks generated by the edge-Markovian evolving graph model.*

We decided to code in Python, and present the code in a Jupyter Notebook "Notebook_mobile_networks".
We made it possible to read or execute our work online. Thus, there are several ways to reproduce our experiments:

#### 1 - Local reproduction - Install Jupyter
If you already use Jupyter (provided with the Anaconda distribution), you can open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or the experimental Jupyter Lab. Please make sure you have all the required packages:

Package requirements:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
time
sklearn
zip

To install these packages, please run the following line in a python terminal:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn zip
```

Then open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab running:
```
jupyter notebook
```
or
```
jupyter lab
```

Then you should run all the cells one by one (some of them may take some time to compute, but we stored the results of the longest ones in the res repository to avoid running them everytime we open the notebook).

### 2 - Online execution
If you do not want to install Jupyter notebook, it is available for executing at the following url:

Please note that any modification you make on this link will NOT be saved.

### 3 - Online reading
Our notebook is also available for simple reading at the following url:
